# 🚦 Traffic Management System for Urban Congestion.

> A multi-layered AI-powered solution to optimize public transport using real-time traffic perception, dynamic routing, and agentic decision-making.

---

## 🔍 Overview

Traditional public transportation relies on static schedules and routes, resulting in:
- Long wait times
- Overcrowding
- Inefficiency
- Poor commuter experience

Our system introduces a 4-Layer AI Stack to create a **Smart, Real-Time Adaptive Transit Ecosystem**.

## 🧠 System Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[YOLOv8 Perception Layer: Detects vehicles, roadblocks, VIP movement] --> B[Agentic AI Core: Real-time traffic control and routing]
    B --> C[Supervisory AI: Validates actions and prevents misbehavior]
    C --> D[User & Authority Interface: App for location input and Admin Dashboard]
```

- **YOLOv8 Perception**: Computer vision layer that detects traffic objects and anomalies.
- **Agentic AI**: Makes autonomous traffic decisions (signals, buses, taxis).
- **Supervisory AI**: Monitors Agentic AI and avoids misbehavior.
- **Interface Layer**: Web app for authorities + Android app for users.
